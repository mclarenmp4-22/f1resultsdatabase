If you're an F1 nerd like me, sometimes questions arise in your mind:

  - When was the last time two people shared a car in a Grand Prix?

  - Both the Toyotas were on dry tyres at the end of the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, so how did Glock's lap times compare to Trulli's?

  - What was the fastest and slowest lap times ever?

  - How many laps have been raced in Formula One history?

  - How much distance has Formula One raced? 

  - What was the race with the most shared cars ever?

  - How many laps in Formula One have been under the safety car/virtual safety car?

Some of this questions cannot be answered by search engines unfortunately.

So, if you're a programmer like me, your answer is just a few SELECTs away.

Or, you can do some cool data analysis with all this data.

#### Note:
This database has every single Grand Prix part of the _World Championship_. It does not contain non-Championship Grands Prix. When the word "Grand Prix" is used here, it refers to a World Championship Grand Prix. Similarly, when the word "Formula One", "F1", "Formula 1", or any of its variants have been used here, it refers to the _World Championship_, even though the 1952 and 1953 seasons were run to F2 regulations. The terms "Formula One", "Grand Prix", and "World Championship" are used synonymously.

## Tables

1. ### Seasons
   This table contains a set of all seasons in F1, from 1950 to the present day.  
   **Columns:**
   - **Season**: The year (e.g. 1982). _INTEGER PRIMARY KEY_
   - **DriversRacesCounted**: How many races counted for drivers. _TEXT_ 

   From 1950 till 1990, you could drop your worst results. In other words, say, for a season, only the points collected for a driver's best 11 races would count towards the championship. It could also be like the best 6 races from the first 7 races, and the best 7 results from the last eight races counted towards the championship.

   Values can range from "Best 11 scores." to 
   
   "Best 5 scores from first 7 races.

   Best 5 scores from last 7 races."

   to "All scores and points are doubled for the last Grand Prix." for the 2014 season. If all races are counted, the value is "All scores."
   - **PointsSharedForSharedCars**: Whether points were shared for shared cars. _BOOLEAN_

   From 1950 till 1957, drivers who shared the same car would have their points shared proportionate to the laps they drove. In other words, Driver A could do 20 laps in a Grand Prix and Driver B would do the other 40 laps. Points would be shared accordingly to both drivers, although it would get a bit complicated. To see an example of this, you may see the results of the [1955 Argentine Grand Prix](https://www.formula1.com/en/results/1955/races/135/argentina/race-result).

   The value is ```true``` if points were shared for shared cars and ```false``` if points were not shared for shared cars.
   - **GrandPrixPointsSystemDrivers**: Points system for drivers. (JSON) _TEXT_
   
   For any row, the data is stored in the following format:

   **Keys**:
   Position (as a string, e.g, "1")/ "Fastest Lap"/ "Fastest Lap (only for finishing in the top 10)" (2019-2024, where the fastest lap point was only awarded for finishing in the top ten)

   **Values**: the points alloted for that specific position or fastest lap.

   For the 1959 season, the value would be:
   ``` 
   {"1": 8, "2": 6, "3": 4, "4": 3, "5": 2, "Fastest Lap": 1}
   ```

   - **SprintPointsSystemDrivers**: Sprint points system for drivers. (JSON) _TEXT_

   For any row, the data is stored in the following format:

   **Keys**:
   Position (as a string, e.g, "1")

   **Values**: the points alloted for that specific position.

   For the 2025 season, the value would be:
   ```
   {"1": 8, "2": 7, "3": 6, "4": 5, "5": 4, "6": 3, "7": 2, "8": 1}
   ```

   - **ConstructorsRacesCounted**: How many races counted for constructors. _TEXT_

   From 1958 (the first year the Constructors' Championship was awarded) till 1978, you could drop your worst results. In other words, say, for a season, only the points collected for a constructor's best 11 races would count towards the championship. It could also be like the best 6 races from the first 7 races, and the best 7 results from the last eight races counted towards the championship.   

   Values can range from "Best 11 scores." to 
   
   "Best 5 scores from first 7 races.

   Best 5 scores from last 7 races."
   to "All scores and points are doubled for the last Grand Prix." for the 2014 season. If all races are counted, the value is "All scores."   
   - **PointsOnlyForTopScoringCar**: Only top scoring car counted for constructors. _BOOLEAN_

   From 1958 till 1978 only the highest finishing car of a Constructor would be awarded points. For example, if the cars of a particular Constructor finished fourth and fifth, only the points scored for fourth place would count towards the Constructors' Championship.

   The value is ```true``` if points were only given towards the Constructors' Championship for the highest placed car and ```false``` if points were not given towards the Constructors' Championship for the highest placed car.   

   - **GrandPrixPointsSystemConstructors**: Points system for constructors. (JSON) _TEXT_

   It is important to note that the same points system wasn't always used for the Drivers' and Constructors' Championship. In 1959 and 1960, the point for Fastest Lap didn't count towards the Constructors' Championship, hence the necessity for this column.

   For any row, the data is stored in the following format:

   **Keys**:
   Position (as a string, e.g, "1")/ "Fastest Lap (only for finishing in the top 10)" (2019-2024, where the fastest lap point was only awarded for finishing in the top ten)

   **Values**: the points alloted for that specific position or fastest lap.

   For the 2024 season, the value would be:
   ``` 
   {"1": 8, "2": 7, "3": 6, "4": 5, "5": 4, "6": 3, "7": 2, "8": 1}
   ```
   - **SprintPointsSystemConstructors**: Sprint points system for constructors. (JSON) _TEXT_

   For any row, the data is stored in the following format:

   **Keys**:
   Position (as a string, e.g, "1")

   **Values**: the points alloted for that specific position.

   For the 2021 season, the value would be:
   ```
   {"1": 3, "2": 2, "3": 1}
   ```
  
   - **RegulationNotes**: Notes about regulations for that season. (JSON) _TEXT_

   The notes are in the form of an array. For the 2020 season, the value would be:
   ```
   ["On 7 August 2020, following a protest by Renault at the Styria GP, the International Automobile Federation's stewards withdrew 15 points from Racing Point for copying the design of Mercedes' brake scoops.", "Qualifying is divided into 3 sessions.", "At the end of the first 18-minute session (Q1), the 5 slowest drivers are eliminated and placed on positions 16 to 20.", "At the end of the second 15-minute session (Q2), the 5 slowest drivers are eliminated and placed on positions 11 to 15.", "A final session (Q3) lasting 12 minutes determines positions 1 to 10 for the 10 remaining drivers.", "At the end of Q1, drivers whose time exceeds 107% of the best time do not qualify."]
   ```
   - **MinimumWeightofCars**: Minimum car weight. _TEXT_

   The values can vary from  "500 kg" to "500 kg (naturally aspirated) or 540 kg (supercharged)" or even "595 kg with driver". It does not get into too much detail about how much weight must be shared by the front and rear tyres, how much the driver and the seat alone must weigh, and so on. For seasons with no weight limit, the value is "free".
   - **EngineType**: Engine type. _TEXT_

   For the turbo-hybrid era, the value is "hybrid, reciprocating 4-stroke with pistons and electric". For previous seasons, the value wold be "reciprocating 4-stroke with pistons". If there is no restriction to the type of engine, the value would be "free".
   - **Supercharging**: Whether forced induction (supercharging or turbocharging) is allowed for that season. _TEXT_

   For seasons where it is allowed, the value would be "authorized". For seasons where it is not allowed, the value would be "forbidden". For 1986, where every single team had turbos, even though there was no rule mandating turbos, the value is "imposed". From 2014 onwards, where turbos are mandatory, the value would be "madatatory".
   - **MaxCylinderCapacity**: Maximum engine displacement. Also can be the allowed engine displacement. _TEXT_

   Values can range from "1500 cc" to "3000 cc (naturally aspirated) or 1500 cc (supercharged)".
   - **NumberOfCylinders**: Number of cylinders, or engine configuration. _TEXT_

   For seasons with no restrictions, the value would be "free". For seasons with a cap on maximum number of cylinders, the value would be, for example, "maximum 12". For seasons where the configuration was mandated, the value could be "V10". For 2006, where every other team except Toro Rosso had V8s, because the FIA granted special permission for Toro Rosso to continue using V10s, the value would be "V8 or V10".
   - **MaxRPM**: Maximum RPM the engine can rev to. _TEXT_

   For seasons where there was no limit on the maximum RPM of the engine, the value would be "free". Otherwise, the value would be the maximum RPM, for example "19 000".
   - **NumberOfEnginesAllowedPerSeason**: Engine allocation per season. _TEXT_

   The values can range from "1 engine per Grand Prix" to  "1 engine for 2 Grand Prix" to "3 per season". For seasons with no cap on the number of engines used, the value would be "free".
   - **FuelType**: Fuel type. _TEXT_

   For seasons where teams could use any type of fuel they wanted, the value would be "free". Otherwise it would tell the type of fuel that the teams could use.
   - **RefuellingAllowed**: Whether refuelling was allowed during a race. _TEXT_

   For seasons where refuelling was allowed, the value would be "authorized". For seasons where refuelling was not allowed, the value would be "forbidden".
   - **MaxFuelConsumption**: Maximum fuel consumption. _TEXT_

   For seasons where there was no limit, the value would be "free". The values can also range from "200 litres" to "free (naturally aspirated) or 195 litres (supercharged)" to "100 kg and 100 kg/hour". In the last example, the first part ("100 kg") shows the fuel tank capacity (the maximum amount of fuel consumed per race) annd the second part ("100 kg/hour") shows the fuel flow limit.

11. ### GrandPrixResults
    This table contains all race entrants for each Grand Prix, with all session results and penalties. It then has all the results for each session that driver competed in. For shared cars, there are separate entries for each driver but it has the _same_ car number. 
    
    Q1 and Q2 can mean different things over different qualifying regulations. From 1950 till 1995, there were two different qualifying sessions, one on Friday (Q1), and one on Saturday (Q2). The best time from both sessions for each driver was counted towards the overall qualifying. In 2003 and 2004, during the first qualifying session (Q1), all the drivers set one lap in championship order, with the last going first and first going last. Then, on the second qualifying session (Q2), the drivers went on another lap, with the last on the first session going first, and the first going last. Then, for the first six races in 2005, there were two different sessions; one on low fuel (Q1), and one on race fuel(Q2). Then the two times would be aggregated to set the overall qualifying times. From 2006, the slowest drivers were eliminated in Q1 and Q2, now just part of qualifying, not two separate sessions. 

    We also have data for practice sessions. This must not be confused with qualifying being called practice previously. There were up to four practice sessions in previous years, with the pre-race warm ups as well. There have been only two practice sessions in some years, and in Sprint weekends we only have one. We currently have three practice sessions in normal weekends.

    We have data for Q1 and Q2 only after 1983. To find drivers who did not pre-qualify or qualify, it is there in overall qualifying. We have data for the Sunday morning warm-up session from 1984 till 2003, when the session no longer happened. 

    In 2021, the Qualifying session set the grid for the Sprint race, and the Sprint set the grid for the Grand Prix, with the top 3 finishers getting 3, 2, and 1 point respectively.

    In 2022, the Qualifying session set the grid for both the Sprint and the race.

    From 2023, there is one qualifying session for the race and one for the sprint.
